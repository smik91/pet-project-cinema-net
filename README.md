The first launch:
1. Create empty MS SQL Server database.
2. Insert the ConnectionString in the appsettings.json file to the "DefaultConnectionString" value. The database will be filled in automatically.
3. The application is ready to use.

IMPORTANT: This is not the final version of the application, it will be finalized by me in the future.
